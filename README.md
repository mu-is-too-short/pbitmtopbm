# pbitmtopbm
pbitm bitmap converters for PBM, these might be of historic interest
to someone.

These programs are GPL'ed, see COPYING for license details.

These tools convert between the pbitm bitmap format from the prc-tools
and the standard PBM bitmap format.

There shouldn't be any problems (the code is dead simple) unless you have
some bizarre system or you lack an ANSI compiler.  You'll need the PBM
libraries and headers installed somewhere or nothing will work.
